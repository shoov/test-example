# Preface

**Don't clone this repo, but fork it - as Shoov is aware to the repository
name, so for the sake of the example, we want to make sure your test is unique**

The end results looks like this:

Remember that Shoov is still in early stages so be gentle. Or contribute a PR.

# Installation

1. Login to [Shoov](http://shoov.gizra.com/#/login) and copy/ paste the code from on the My account page, in order to get your access token
1. Fork this repo, and clone it
1. Install mocha globally ``npm install -g mocha``
1. Follow [installation](https://github.com/webdriverio/webdrivercss#install) notes for WebdriverCss
1. ``npm install``

## Providers

For local testing use phantomJs ``phantomjs --webdriver=4444``

Otherwise you can use BrowserStack or Sauce Labs:

```bash
# Set BrowserStack keys
export BROWSERSTACK_USERNAME=<username>
export BROWSERSTACK_KEY=<token>
```

OR

```bash
# Set Suace Labs keys
export SAUCE_USERNAME=<username>
export SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY=<token>
```

# Usage

``mocha`` will tests all the files under the ``test`` folder.

The example file shows how a single test file can be executed under multiple platforms and browsers. Assuming we are using browserstack, this can be executed by passing the environment argument like this:

```bash
# Execute the tests using the ie11 config.
PROVIDER_PREFIX=browserstack SELECTED_CAPS=ie11 mocha

# Execute the tests using the chrome on Mac config.
PROVIDER_PREFIX=browserstack SELECTED_CAPS=chrome mocha

# Execute the tests with the default capabilities provided by the `shoov-webdrivercss` library.
mocha
```

After a regression was found check your [Builds](http://shoov.gizra.com/#/builds) page, or go directly to the link indicated by the failing Mocha test.
